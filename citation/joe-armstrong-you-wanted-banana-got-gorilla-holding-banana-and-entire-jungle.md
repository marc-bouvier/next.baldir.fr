**Seibel:** So you started out saying software reuse is “appallingly bad,” but opening up every black box and fiddling with it all hardly seems like movement toward reusing software.
 
**Armstrong:** I think the lack of reusability comes in object-oriented languages, not in functional languages. Because the problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.”
