# Building a making-of for my projects

---
## What ?

Writing while doing (and sometimes doodling)

![A wizard writing with a pencil on a sheet of paper](/public/img/cover_images/partager-avec-soin.png)

---
## Why ?

Helps reflect on my work

Helps articulate clearly my thought

Help me debugging ([Mikado Method](https://mikadomethod.info/)) keeping track where I am

---
## Spontaneous

Capture my emotions / state of mind

---
## Transparent

Captures my choices and also my **non-choices**

I am human and I struggle (not always shown in the final artifact)

Preserve intention and context

---
## Journey

Following the making of is like travelling with me

---

## Bonus !

At least there is an artifact (even if I fail)

I can stop at any point

Ready-made blog post !
